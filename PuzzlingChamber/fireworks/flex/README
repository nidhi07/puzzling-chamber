This is the Flex version of the js-fireworks experiment.
Truth be told, I don't have the tools to compile Flex any more.
I assume all the code is here.  

I worked from the brillant FluidSolver project.

How to compile:
1)  Get Eclipse
2)  Install the beta of Powerflasher (FDT)
3)  When building the AS3 application, put "-target-player=10.0.0" in the compiler arguments
4)  Compile

It's translucent, so on a white background it looks very invisible :)
